I'm Yi, originally from Taiwan. Transitioning from four years of project management experience in the media and fintech industries to pursue a career as a software engineer. I'm also actively contributing to open-source projects, particularly with [Creative Commons](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/). 

On my journey to transition into engineering, I've received a lot of help from others. As a result, I've decided to document my learning process here, hoping it can also assist you! If you encounter any difficulties in your transition, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
